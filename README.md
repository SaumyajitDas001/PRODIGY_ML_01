# PRODIGY_ML_01
This repository contains a regression-based machine learning project developed for **Prodigy Infotech** to predict house prices using features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms. The workflow includes data preprocessing (handling missing values and outliers), feature engineering (combining and encoding features), and building a Linear Regression model with evaluation metrics like MSE and RÂ². The dataset includes training and test files, with predictions saved as a CSV file. Suggestions for improvement include using advanced models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost), hyperparameter tuning, and k-fold cross-validation. This project is implemented in Python using pandas, scikit-learn, and related libraries.
