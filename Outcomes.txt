Here I am Discussing how to Increase the Overall Accuracy of Linear Regression Model.

1. Feature Engineering
Increase the number of features: Bring in more correlated features like YearBuilt, TotalBsmtSF, GarageArea, etc., as expected by putting together descriptions into your dataset.
Create new features: Use existing features to make new features (like TotalBathrooms = FullBath + HalfBath * 0.5 + BsmtFullBath + BsmtHalfBath * 0.5).
Scale the features: Normalize or standardize features-one may do so especially since models may be sensitive to change.
Categorical encoding: Convert categorical features, for example, Neighborhood or MSZoning, into numerical values by using techniques like one-hot encoding or ordinal encoding.

2. Handle Missing Values
Have an explanation of why values are missing. Intelligently fill in missing values:
Mean/Median imputation for numerical features.
Mode imputation for categorical features.
Advanced methods: egKNN imputation.

3. Outlier Detection
Remove or treat outliers in high impact numerical columns such as GrLivArea, SalePrice, etc.
Techniques to remove outliers include Z-score and ComMerchant's IQR (Interquartile Range) method.

4. Use advanced models instead of the Linear Regression
Such advanced models could be and not limited to:
Decision Trees or Random Forests.
Gradient Boosting methods (e.g. XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost).
Neural Networks for more complicated patterns.
Also, multi-modeling and combining.

5. Hyperparameter Tuning
Optimum tuning of parameters in models by grid search or randomized search.

6. Cross Validation
It ensures that k-fold cross-validation will deliver an optimum model performance for application on unseen data 

7. Address Multicollinearity 
Removal or combination of highly correlated features in avoiding redundancy and overfitting.
